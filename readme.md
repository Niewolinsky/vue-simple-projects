# Simple Projects Made In Vue 3

This repository is a collection of simple projects that I have coded,
while learning JavaScript and Vue framework.
I have built most of these projects while following a youtube tutorial.
There are some ideas that i created on my own. Since none of the projects deserve their own repository
they are grouped in here using git branches, each branch is their own app.


## Additional Information

- Uses newest JavaScript ES6+ syntax
- Uses Vue 3 + Composition API + <script setup>
- Apps built locally with Vite 2
- Minimal CSS, uniform blank-like styling


## Installation

Clone repo and use Vite

```bash
    VITE!!!!
    npm run dev
```
